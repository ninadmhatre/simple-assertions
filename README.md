# simple-assertions

Assertion library (skeleton) heavily inspired from `assertpy` but without batteries!

# Motivation

`assertpy` is beautiful library but for my needs it's too much, i really loved the API of
`assertpy` so i created new module because of following reasons

please check `tests/test_*.py` for use cases. 

1. I wanted `assert_warn` to be dynamic, i.e. given certain condition all assertions are converted to
warning.
   - I added `ASSERT_ERROR_AS_WARNING` variable which can do that!
   - Modified `assert_that` API to make is call based with `assert_that(.., as_warn=True)`
2. Extending is possible but i wanted more intuitive logic
   - I exposed the `SimpleAssertions` class, and just inherit it to add new method
3. `assert_that` in `assertpy` creates new instance of class and loads all the extensions on every
call, and i wanted to avoid that!
   - By exposing the `SimpleAssertion` class, you can just make it part of your assertion class

## Usage

Please check `tests` files for more usage here is only basic usage

### As Function
Just import the `assert_that` function, and away you go...

```python
from simple_assertions import assert_that

def test_something():
    assert_that(4 + 10).is_equal_to(14)
    assert_that(1).is_instance_of(int)
    assert_that(3, "lucky_num", as_warn=True).is_equal_to(4)
```

### As instance

```python
from simple_assertions import SimpleAssertions

class YourTestClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.assert_that = SimpleAssertions().assert_that

    def test_something(self):
        self.assert_that(4 + 10).is_equal_to(14)
        self.assert_that(1).is_instance_of(int)
        self.assert_that(3, "lucky_num", as_warn=True).is_equal_to(4)      
```

### Add your own batteries
```python
from simple_assertions import SimpleAssertions
from typing import Union

class YourAssertions(SimpleAssertions):
    def __init__(self, as_warn=False, logger=None):
        super().__init__(as_warn, logger)

    def is_greater_than(self, other: Union[int, float]):
        if self.val_to_chk.val < other:
            self.error(self.generate_err_msg(other, "to be greater than"))
        return self


class YourTestClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.assert_that = YourAssertions().assert_that

    def test_something(self):
        self.assert_that(4 + 10).is_greater_than(10).is_equal_to(14)
        self.assert_that(1).is_instance_of(int)
        self.assert_that(3, "lucky_num", as_warn=True).is_equal_to(4)      
```

Though only checked with `unittests` but it should work fine with [pytest](http://pytest.org/) or [Nose](http://nose.readthedocs.org/).


## Installation
